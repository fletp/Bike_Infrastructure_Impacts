Estimating the impacts of improved bicycling infrastructure on bike riding behavior in New York City. See [Final Report](https://github.com/fletp/Bike_Infrastructure_Impacts/blob/main/CEE_4620_FinalProject_Paper_FletcherPassow.pdf) for more information. This project was my final project for CEE 4620: Analysis and Control of Transportation Systems and Networks, which I took at Cornell in Spring 2018.
